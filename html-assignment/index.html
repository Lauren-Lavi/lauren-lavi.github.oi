        <p>Hi there, I'm Lauren.</p>
        <p>I am new to programing, and eger to learn more about it! I've done snippets of code in discord and taught myself a little for the use of things like italics and bolding, but I've been curious how this all really works. I'm also quite passionate about languages, and though web languages may be different from english or french, I hope this one helps me uncipher another language I have used but never known. </p>
        <p>Though coding may be relatively new to me, when it comes to using programs and/or teaching myself, I'm an expert! I've taught myself most of Adobe Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Adobe Lightroom Classic, Adobe Audition, Adobe Premier, and Adobe Illustration to name a few. Out of the bunch, I'm strongest in digital art and vectors. However, I want to make myself more versatile in terms of my skill set.I think UX/UI design and coding could do me some good! Plus, if I get the chance to learn even more complexe coding languages this may come in handy in terms of knowing certain things that I'd need to be weary, if I am teaching myself in my spare time.</p>
        
        <p> Anyways, enough about me, how are you doing today? I hope all is well and you feel alright. Be sure to pace yourself and be kind if it's been a rough day. The future holds great things for you. Have a quote that inspires me to go on as the going gets rough:</p>
