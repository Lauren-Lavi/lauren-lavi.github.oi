        </article>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Lauren!</p>
        <p>As of September 9<sup>th</sup> I am new to programing, and <em>eager</em> to learn more about it! I've done snippets of code in discord, taught myself a little bit  for the use of things like <em>italics</em> and <strong>bolding</strong>, but I've been curious on what exactly I am doing and want to understand. I'm also quite passionate about languages, and though web languages may be different from english or french, I hope this one helps me uncipher another language I have used but never known. </p>
        <p>Though coding may be <em>relatively</em> new to me, when it comes to using programs and/or teaching myself, I'm an expert! I've taught myself all these programs including:
           <abbr title="Adobe Photoshop">PS</abbr>, <abbr title="Clip Studio Paint">CSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Adobe Lightroom Classic">LrC</abbr>, <abbr title="Adobe Audition">Au</abbr>, <abbr title="Adobe Premier">Pr</abbr>, and <abbr title="Adobe Illustration">AI</abbr>.
             Out of the bunch, I'm strongest in digital art and vectors. However, I want to make myself more versatile in terms of my skill set.I think UX/UI design and coding could do me some good! Plus, if I get the chance to learn even more complexe coding languages this may come in handy in terms of knowing certain things that I'd need to be weary about, if I am teaching myself in my spare time.</p>
        
        <p> Anyways, enough about me, how are you doing today? I hope all is well and you feel alright. Be sure to pace and be kind to yourself. The future holds great things for you. Have a quote that inspires me to go on as the going gets rough:</p>
