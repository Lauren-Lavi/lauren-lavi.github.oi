        <p>Hi there, I'm Lauren!</p>
        <img id="my-image" src="images/Le_Moi.jpg" alt="profile photo of Lauren" width="500"/>
        <p>I'm a semi-recent highschool grad who took a victory lap, and had a change of plans for what I planned to do when the pandemic it. I wanted to study french or animation at a university in Quebec <del datetime="2021-09-29T20:00:00Z">partically because I'm french, but also because I love the food and cities out there</del>. However this program caught my attention for the more versatile skillset it offered, <em>noteably coding and having animation</em> but it also fit my interests which is why I chose it. </p>
        <p>As of September 9<sup>th</sup> I am new to programing, and am <strong>eager</strong> to learn more about it! I've done snippets of code in discord, taught myself a little bit  for the use of things like <em>italics</em> and <strong>bolding</strong>, but I've been curious on what exactly I am doing. I want to understand and expand my skills. I'm also quite passionate about languages, and though web languages may be different from English or French, I hope this one helps me decipher another language I have used but never known. </p>
        <p>Though coding may be <em>relatively</em> new to me, when it comes to using programs and/or teaching myself, I'm an expert! I've taught myself all these programs including:
           <abbr title="Adobe Photoshop">PS</abbr>, <abbr title="Clip Studio Paint">CSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Adobe Lightroom Classic">LrC</abbr>, <abbr title="Adobe Audition">Au</abbr>, <abbr title="Adobe Premier">Pr</abbr>, and <abbr title="Adobe Illustration">AI</abbr>.
             Out of the bunch, I'm strongest in digital art and vectors. However, I want to make myself more versatile in terms of my skill set.I think UX/UI design and coding could do me some good! Plus, if I get the chance to learn even more complex coding languages this may come in handy in terms of knowing certain things that I'd need to be weary about, if I am teaching myself in my spare time.</p>
