                <p>*insert the long long longgggggggest of long text about a starfish right here! For your eyes, and only yours! If someone else is peaking at this then they shouldn't be. Or else they may see something they
                    don't like here* But anyways there seems to be a need of more filler content before this gets turned into information so you can keep reeeading what I write on a whim or proceed on to the next backup I'm just using this
                    as placeholder text tho there is other ways to insert placeholder, and this is a very very run on sentance. 0 outta 10, do not recommend them but they sure do work like a charm when writing random stuff to put in here. 
                    I'm actually trying to remember the lessons where we went over adjusting images, I was really drowsey that day and that's good info but anyways I digress. I think. I also kinda want to draw and I finally figured out what I am 
                    gonna shoot for photography today! Some pumpkins! I better take a peak soon! If you made it through my hyper long run on sentances, you deserve a prize! Here have a cookie *hands you a gingerbread cookie*.
